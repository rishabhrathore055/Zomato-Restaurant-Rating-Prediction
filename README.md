# Zomato Restaurant Rating Prediction
In this project, I am analysing the Zomato dataset to get a fair idea about the factors that affect the aggregate rating of each restaurant. The establishment of different types of restaurants in different places preprocessed the dataset and cleaned the data. The dataset has more than 50,000 restaurants, with restaurants serving dishes from across India. I tried out several models to find the best performance and selected the best model that predicted the rating of each restaurant.
